* Testing in Go

There are many different ways to test your Go programs.

There are many competing methods, testing frameworks, etc.

Today, I will detail some of the approaches that have worked best for me.

Use my experience for reference, but not as a rigid set of rules.

* What is a "self-contained" test?

My definition of a _self-contained_ test is one which does not require any
external communication.  This could mean:

- a network service
- another binary
- files in the filesystem

Most tests should be able to run by simply using `go test ./...`, without
build tags or configuration.

Integration tests with MySQL, redis, etc. are out of scope for this talk.

: Enabling your tests to run without external dependencies is important!
#
: Writing code that only works on Linux isn't friendly to those on OSX,
: and vice-versa
#
: In the same vein, requiring MySQL, redis, or any other service is unfriendly
: as well.
#
: It's almost always possible to write nice, clean, self-contained tests.
#
: Save the database and filesystem interactions for integration tests.

* Basic testing

Let's start with a simple example!

.play self-contained-testing-in-go/1/divide.go

: This code works as-is, and if we hit Run, it produces an output we expect.
#
: Nothing too fancy going on here.  No error handling at all.

* Basic testing (cont.)

A first pass at a test for function `Divide()`.  Tests using a single pair of
inputs to produce an expected output.

.code self-contained-testing-in-go/1/divide_test.go

	$ go test -v .
	=== RUN   TestDivide
	--- PASS: TestDivide (0.00s)
	PASS
	ok      _/home/matt/src/github.com/mdlayher/talks/self-contained-testing-in-go/1  0.001s

: We can write a test for this code rather easily.  This test is acceptable,
: but it only covers a single case.
#
: Good tests should check for a variety of inputs and outputs.

* Basic testing (cont.)

But what happens when we try to divide by zero?

.play self-contained-testing-in-go/2/divide.go

: In elementary school, I learned that dividing any number by zero produces the
: result 0.
#
: Turns out, this isn't quite correct.
#
: What happens when we run this code with variable b set to 0?
#
: We get a panic and a stacktrace.  Not a very friendly user experience.
#
: In addition, our previous test didn't bother to check for this case.
#
: Can we do better?

* Improving Divide

We can protect against division by zero by checking if `b == 0` before
performing the division operation.

.play self-contained-testing-in-go/3/divide.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

Now that `Divide()` can return either a valid result or an error, we should write
tests which check for both results.

: Functions with multiple return values are rather common in Go.
#
: Here, we can add a check for b == 0 and return an error if bad input is
: provided by a user.
#
: This is more friendly, and won't cause your program to immediately crash with
: a panic.
#
: We should add a test case for b == 0!

* Table-driven tests

When testing more than one case for a simple function, use table-driven tests!

Make a table of tests with various inputs, outputs, and expected errors.  Giving
each test a name helps with "sub-tests", as we'll see shortly.

.code self-contained-testing-in-go/3/divide_test.go /START TABLE OMIT/,/END TABLE OMIT/

: Table-driven tests are one of my favorite constructs in Go.
#
: They enable you to create a table of tests which can provide a variety of
: inputs and expected outputs for simple functions.
#
: Table-driven tests are great for checking the output of math functions,
: string parsing functions, etc.
#
: However, they are not always so great for network services.  We'll get to that
: a little later on.

* Table-driven tests (cont.)

For each test table case, create a sub-test with the given name, and then
check the results of `Divide()` against the results from the test table.

.code self-contained-testing-in-go/3/divide_test.go /START LOOP OMIT/,/END LOOP OMIT/

: The actual testing happens within the loop of a table-driven test.
#
: In this case, we're taking advantage of Go 1.7's subtests to isolate
: each test case and provide cleaner output.
#
: Essentially, we perform the function we are testing with fixed inputs,
: and then verify that it produces the error we expect (which may be none),
: and the correct result for a Divide operation.

* Table-driven tests (cont.)

The `want, got` pattern is helpful for copying and pasting checks, and easily
modifying them in the future.

Need only change what is assigned to `want` and `got`.

.code self-contained-testing-in-go/3/divide_test.go /START CHECK OMIT/,/END CHECK OMIT/

Nice output format for when your tests aren't passing.

	--- FAIL: TestDivide/OK (0.00s)
		divide_test.go:42: unexpected result:
			- want: 1
			-  got: 2

: The want, got pattern seems a little strange, but it's a pattern I've found to
: be immensely useful.
#
: It enables you to easily check for various conditions simply by changing the
: variables assigned to want and got.  It's friendlier than copying and pasting
: some long structure field name, or slice index.
#
: In addition, by lining up the output using newlines and spaces, we are able to
: easily compare the expected result against the result that was output by our
: function.

* Table-driven tests (cont.)

When combined with sub-tests, table-driven tests produce nicely-formatted output
that indicates exactly which test cases are passing or failing.

	$ go test -v .
	=== RUN   TestDivide
	=== RUN   TestDivide/divide_by_zero
	=== RUN   TestDivide/OK
	--- PASS: TestDivide (0.00s)
		--- PASS: TestDivide/divide_by_zero (0.00s)
		--- PASS: TestDivide/OK (0.00s)
	PASS
	ok      _/home/matt/src/github.com/mdlayher/talks/self-contained-testing-in-go/3        0.001s

Sub-tests are new in Go 1.7.  Use them to run single test cases.

	$ go test -v -run=TestDivide/divide_by_zero .
	=== RUN   TestDivide
	=== RUN   TestDivide/divide_by_zero
	--- PASS: TestDivide (0.00s)
	--- PASS: TestDivide/divide_by_zero (0.00s)
	PASS
	ok      _/home/matt/src/github.com/mdlayher/talks/self-contained-testing-in-go/3        0.001s

: I cannot recommend sub-tests enough.  They allow you to break your monolithic
: tests into smaller chunks that can be run individually.
#
: Sub-tests allow you to debug code with much less noise, since you can run a
: failing test case in isolation until it passes.
#
: If your table-driven tests aren't using sub-tests yet, I highly recommend
: modifying them to do so.  It'll make your life a lot easier in the long run.

* Testing using the filesystem

On Linux, `/proc` contains a lot of useful info.

We want to parse `/proc/cmdline` to retrieve boot parameters.

How can we test this on non-Linux machines?

: While it may be useful to try and grab the output from the filesystem for
: integration tests, it prevents coworkers running OSX, Windows, etc. from
: verifying that your test is correct.
#
: Whenever possible, make sure that you are able to appropriately mock
: interactions with a filesystem.
#
: This can be done with interfaces or clever use of closures, but today,
: we'll talk about a very simple solution.

* Testing using the filesystem (cont.)

Here's a first pass at a function to read `/proc/cmdline`.

How can we test this function without depending on the filesystem?

.code self-contained-testing-in-go/5/cmdline.go /START CMDLINE OMIT/,/END CMDLINE OMIT/

Error handling omitted for brevity.  Please check all errors in production code.

: As you can see, this function relies on opening a specific file in the
: filesystem.  This won't run on OSX or Windows, at all.
#
: If you're familiar with Go, you'll know that an os.File implements the
: interface, io.Reader.
#
: We can use this to our advantage to write cross-platform friendly tests
: and verify a wide variety of scenarios.

* Testing using the filesystem (cont.)

The `io.Reader` interface is the answer!

By creating a function that accepts an `io.Reader`, we can use a wide variety
of types as input for our tests.

.code self-contained-testing-in-go/5/cmdline.go /START IOREADER OMIT/,/END IOREADER OMIT/

: By separating the concern of opening the file and parsing its output,
: we are able to easily create a much more testable function.
#
: 100% code coverage often isn't necessary to produce quality tests.  In
: this case, we trust that os.Open does what we would expect, and only
: worry about parsing the output of the file.
#
: It isn't recommended to use ioutil.ReadAll for large files, but since this
: particular file is rather small, it's acceptable to use here.
#
: By assigning the "no boot image" error to a variable, we are able to use
: that variable in tests to check that malformed output is appropriately
: rejected.
#
: Again, this is just one solution to the problem.  A more intricate solution
: could stub filesystem interactions using an interface.  For our purposes,
: with a single file, this is arguably the easiest approach.

* Testing using the filesystem (cont.)

Using table-driven tests, we can pass any `io.Reader` to our function for
testing.  `strings.NewReader()` wraps a string as an `io.Reader`.

.code self-contained-testing-in-go/5/cmdline_test.go /START TESTTABLE OMIT/,/END TESTTABLE OMIT/

: Test tables are a great solution for testing the new ParseCommandLine
: function.
#
: Using this approach, we can specify any io.Reader.  In this case, it's
: easy to use strings.NewReader to wrap a string in an io.Reader.
#
: This way, we can test against a variety of malformed file output
: and ensure that our code handles all errors gracefully.

* Testing using the filesystem (cont.)

This should look familiar!

No need to rely on the filesystem for tests if we can mock the data
using interfaces.

.code self-contained-testing-in-go/5/cmdline_test.go /START TESTLOOP OMIT/,/END TESTLOOP OMIT/

: The test loop looks very similar to our previous test loop.
#
: By using sub-tests for each test case, we are able to effectively isolate
: single tests from the test table.  Great for tracking down a nasty
: corner case.

* Testing network services

Suppose we have a Client type that we want to test with mock data.

We want to verify that our Client accepts correct data from a server, and
that it rejects incorrect data.

Repeatedly performing test setup and teardown code is a hassle.  Relying on
external services makes tests difficult to run.

Closures are the perfect solution to our problem.

: Ideally, a test should not depend on any external service or state to
: work properly.
#
: Go provides a rather elegant solution to the problem of testing HTTP-based
: services.

* Testing network services (cont.)

A simple HTTP client which checks for an output string from a `/status` endpoint.

.code self-contained-testing-in-go/4/client.go /START CLIENT OMIT/,/END CLIENT OMIT/

Error handling omitted for brevity.  Please check all errors in production code.

: This is a very bare-bones client for a HTTP service.  It checks for an output
: string from a /status endpoint and returns it to the caller.

* Testing network services (cont.)

We create a test helper, `testClient()`, which makes use of `net/http/httptest`
to set up a self-contained HTTP server.

.code self-contained-testing-in-go/4/client_test.go /START TESTCLIENT OMIT/,/END TESTCLIENT OMIT/

A Client is created and pointed to the test server, and a "done" closure is
returned to clean up resources.

: To enable easily testing our Client, we want to be able to point it to an
: isolated HTTP server, and allow easy cleanup of resources at the end of
: our tests.
#
: By accepting a function with the correct signature for the http.Handler
: interface, we are able to spin up an isolated HTTP test server which runs
: our function on each HTTP request.
#
: Returning a closure allows the caller to easily perform cleanup of any
: intermediate state.  More actions could be added to the closure, such as
: cleaning up a database, closing socket listeners, etc.

* Testing network services (cont.)

Using `testClient()` is simple!  It enables testing that the Client's HTTP request sends
correct data.  It also enables mocking the HTTP response.

.code self-contained-testing-in-go/4/client_test.go /START TEST OMIT/,/END TEST OMIT/

: Using the testClient is simple!  Calling the function gives us a Client that
: is pointed at the isolated HTTP test server.
#
: Making any HTTP requests with the client will cause code from the closure to
: be invoked.
#
: This way, we can check that a Client method sends a HTTP request to the
: correct path, with the correct HTTP method, headers, etc.
#
: Finally, we can write arbitrary output back to our Client, to ensure it
: appropriately handles both good and bad inputs.

* Testing network services (cont.)

This pattern works great with all kinds of network services.

Example: calling `net.Listen("tcp", ":0")` will create a TCP listener on a random port.

You can create a `net/http/httptest`-like API for all kinds of network services.

: With a little bit of work, you can build a type similar to the
: net/http/httptest test server.
#
: Just open a TCP or UDP connection with port specified to 0 to allow the OS
: to pick an appropriate port.
#
: Create your Client type and point it at your test server.
#
: Allow the test server and resources to be gracefully cleaned up using a closure.

* Testing with a database

This pattern can also be applied to database connections.

	func TestDB(t *testing.T) {
		err := withDB(t, func(db *sql.DB) error {
			// Could be wrapped in subtests!
			testDBCreate(t, db)
			testDBReadWrite(t, db)
			testDBTruncuate(t, db)
			return nil
		})
		if err != nil {
			t.Fatalf("unexpected error: %v", err)
		}
	}

	func withDB(t *testing.T, fn func(db *sql.DB) error) error {
		db := setupDB()
		defer teardownDB(db)

		return fn(db)
	})

Can be useful to use SQLite or similar during tests!

: In this case, we create a SQL database handle that only exists for the
: duration of our closure.
#
: The withDB helper handles setup and teardown of database connections, or
: any external state.
#
: We can run a series of tests, possibly as sub-tests, using the same database
: handle.
#
: If you use standard SQL queries, this can be used to run your tests with a
: temporary, in-memory, SQLite database, even if your production code connects
: to MySQL, PostgreSQL, or similar.
